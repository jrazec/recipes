# Recipes

Hi! This is a Recipes Project as part of the Odin Project Curriculum.
Here I borrowed [allrecipe's](https://www.allrecipes.com/) recipes which are the following recipes:
- **Baked Potato Soup** Recipe by [Sherry Haupt](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/12997/baked-potato-soup-i/)
- **Broccoli Cauliflower Casserole** Recipe by [MUSTANGSTEPH21](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/234281/broccoli-cauliflower-casserole/)
- **Baked Ziti** Recipe by [Colleen](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/11758/baked-ziti-i/)

# What I've learned
 Here I just refreshed myself in html syntax such as:
- ul's and ol's
- h1-h6
- strong,em,i,b
- img, a
- folder and link management
- just most of the html as is XD

However I focused more on grasping my git & github skills!
